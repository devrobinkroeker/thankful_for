# thankful_for

Update: No active coding here!

This is a website made with [VueJs](https://vuejs.org) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). It might help to find positive things in your day. You post for what you're thankful and get inspired by what the others are thankful for.

If you have any questions about the project, setup or technologies I use feel free to contact me!
